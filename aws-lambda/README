AWS Lambda function

Commands for deploying the function and running the function are contained in the upload_lambda_command.txt and run_lambda_command.txt 
files, respectively.

When creating the executable, care needs to be taken to make sure it is compiled to arm64 and a linux OS, as those are what AWS will
use to run the lambda. If you are working in Windows, this can be accomplished by either compiling in a WSL:Linux instance or by
setting your GOOS to linux before compiling.
